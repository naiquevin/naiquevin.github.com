      <p>Last week we decided to use <a href="http://www.naturaldocs.org/">NaturalDocs</a>
for Javascript documentation at work. I noticed that a few of my
colleagues who are SublimeText users started using a plugin that
inserts docstring skeleton in code. I tried to find a similar mode in
emacs but couldn't find one. But this is emacs right? and it's called
a "programmers editor" for a reason. What do you do if you need some
functionality and there isn't a mode for it?  You simply write your
own!</p>
<p>So, I decided to spend a few hours of this weekend writing some elisp
code for intelligently inserting NaturalDocs style docstring in
javascript. Here is the result and I am quite happy with it.</p>
<p><img alt="emacs ns-js in action" src="theme/images/nd-js-screenshot.gif" /></p>
<p>You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/naiquevin/emacs-config/blob/master/naiquevin/nd-js.el">here</a></p>
<p>It was an 'achievement unlocked' moment for me as this is the first
time I have written emacs lisp that comes so close to being called a
"mode". But I will not call it a "mode" yet for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I know it just works but isn't packaged like other emacs mode out
  there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code may be violating elisp code conventions. I need to read up
  more on this topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right now some code seems to be 'imperative' and can be made a lot
  more 'functional'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It only supports javascript but can be extended to other
  languages. After all NaturalDocs work for many languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It needs to be refactored to improve test coverage. I have done some
  unit testing using assert statements but there is probably a better
  way that supports mocking the buffer, point etc..  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the coming days, I plan to work on these points.</p>
<p>This was also the first time I learnt how to work with the elisp
manual. Earlier I had tried to read it as a book. But with no clear
task in mind, I lost the motivation soon. This time I had a task to
accomplish and after breaking it down into smaller tasks it was very
easy to search through the manual. I found it to be very well written
and was sufficient most of the times although a few times I had to
resort to stackoverflow.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will release it as a mode some day.</p>
