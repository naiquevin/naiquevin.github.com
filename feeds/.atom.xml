&lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, another fine static
site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octopress is awesome but after some time I felt it didn't work for
me. It would not be fair to blame Octopress for this because the real
issue was my passing familiarity with the Ruby language. I couldn't
tweak and hack it as per my wish without spending much time learning
the package management and the intricacies of the language itself
(which I don't have time for at the moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static site generators written in Python were an obvious choice for me
when I started looking for alternatives. Having heard good things
about &lt;a href="http://mynt.mirroredwhite.com/"&gt;Mynt&lt;/a&gt; I tried that first. But
then I tried Pelican and liked it more, particularly for it's simple
workflow - probably exactly how it would have been if I would write
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme is my
&lt;a href="https://github.com/naiquevin/blog-src/tree/master/naiq"&gt;own creation&lt;/a&gt;. For
some one like me, having non-existent knowledge of design, the easiest
way to build a good looking site is to take inspiration from others
;-). The layout and even the typography is heavily inspired by
&lt;a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/"&gt;Armin Ronacher's blog&lt;/a&gt;. The colors are
somewhat lifted from the awesome
&lt;a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized"&gt;Solarized theme&lt;/a&gt; (that I use
everyday in my editor). I desperately wanted to stay away from Twitter
Bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To migrate posts from Octopress to Pelican I wrote a
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/naiquevin/4972374"&gt;python script&lt;/a&gt;. The format
of both being markdown, it was quite trivial. While at it, I also
migrated my short posts about emacs tricks and tips from my posterous
blog now that posterous is
&lt;a href="http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous"&gt;going to shutdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are quite a few ideas and topics I have in mind (and
drafts) to blog about. So looking forward to make yet another attempt
at blogging (yes, seriously!)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category></entry></feed>
