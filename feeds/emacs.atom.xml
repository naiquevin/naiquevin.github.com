for Javascript documentation at work. I noticed that a few of my
colleagues who are SublimeText users started using a plugin that
inserts docstring skeleton in code. I tried to find a similar mode in
emacs but couldn't find one. But this is emacs right? and it's called
a "programmers editor" for a reason. What do you do if you need some
functionality and there isn't a mode for it?  You simply write your
own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to spend a few hours of this weekend writing some elisp
code for intelligently inserting NaturalDocs style docstring in
javascript. Here is the result and I am quite happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="emacs ns-js in action" src="theme/images/nd-js-screenshot.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code &lt;a href="https://github.com/naiquevin/emacs-config/blob/master/naiquevin/nd-js.el"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an 'achievement unlocked' moment for me as this is the first
time I have written emacs lisp that comes so close to being called a
"mode". But I will not call it a "mode" yet for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it just works but isn't packaged like other emacs mode out
  there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code may be violating elisp code conventions. I need to read up
  more on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now some code seems to be 'imperative' and can be made a lot
  more 'functional'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only supports javascript but can be extended to other
  languages. After all NaturalDocs work for many languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs to be refactored to improve test coverage. I have done some
  unit testing using assert statements but there is probably a better
  way that supports mocking the buffer, point etc..  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming days, I plan to work on these points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the first time I learnt how to work with the elisp
manual. Earlier I had tried to read it as a book. But with no clear
task in mind, I lost the motivation soon. This time I had a task to
accomplish and after breaking it down into smaller tasks it was very
easy to search through the manual. I found it to be very well written
and was sufficient most of the times although a few times I had to
resort to stackoverflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I will release it as a mode some day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="emacs"></category><category term="NaturalDocs"></category><category term="Javascript"></category></entry><entry><title>Own the Editor</title><link href="http://naiquevin.github.io/own-the-editor.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-11T23:28:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Vineet Naik</name></author><id>tag:naiquevin.github.io,2012-05-11:own-the-editor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I have noticed a changing trend in the choice of text editor/IDE among my
colleagues. From 100% Eclipse users a few months back, today we have -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/a&gt; Users&lt;br /&gt;
3 &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; Users&lt;br /&gt;
1 &lt;a href="http://www.vim.org/"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; User&lt;br /&gt;
1 &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; User  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the lone emacs user which you would already guessed from the
tagline of this blog. This post is not about emacs though.  I used
Eclipse for a long time until I discovered Emacs which was about 1
year ago. I don't regret switching to emacs, but looking back, I admit
that I wasn't a good eclipse user then because I never really used it
beyond writing code and using it's subversion client for version
control.  So, while it's good to see people moving to Sublime Text2 (a
fine editor) and Vim (an awesome editor) from IDEs which I personally
hate, it's important to realize that an editor will work wonders for
your productivity only when you learn to use it to it's full potential
and it's only then that you can appreciate the awesomeness of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I am trying to make here is that whichever editor/IDE you
choose to use, you must use it like YOU OWN IT! If you are a
programmer, then the editor is your primary toolkit because you spend
more than 60% of your time inside it and so there is no reason for not
trying to master it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about what you must look for in an editor for efficient
and enjoyable editing and it will also try to cover some of the must
know tricks irrespective of which editor you use.  Your editor may not
support all these features but there is a good chance that they do and
you haven't yet had the time or reason to discover them.  So if you
think that you are only complacently using your editor and not getting
the most out of it, I think this post will show you some direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A few important points first&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I don't claim to be an emacs guru although I am a passionate
user.  Secondly, in this post, you will find that I have mentioned
emacs a lot of times although having said that the post is not about
it. The intention is not to annoy the readers. Wherever applicable, I
have mentioned how to do a particular thing in emacs or the term used
for it so you can then easily google it up for some other editor as in
"abc equivalent of emacs in X editor" or "How to do abc in editor X?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Terminology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other things, before you can dive deep into something, it's
very important to have an understanding of the terms that other folks
in the community use to describe different things related to the
editor.  Unless you are familiar with the terms and their meanings you
will not be able to communicate on mailing lists and forums where
there are a lot of people with talent and readiness to help you out.
So get yourself familiar with atleast some of the basic terminology
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shortcuts and mouse-less editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing and using shortcuts is a key to faster editing. As a quick
example, it's obviously faster to type ctrl-s than clicking on File &amp;gt;
Save. A killer thing about text editors such as vim and emacs is
economy of motion, which means that the shortcuts and key sequences
are specifically designed in such a fashion that it's easier and
faster for the fingers to type. Well this makes them time consuming to
learn and get used to initially, but if you make a determined effort
then very soon they are registered into muscle memory and you hardly
have to think while using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that using mouse is not particularly efficient while
writing code so you should avoid that as much as possible.  Learning
shortcuts fixes this.  In the rest of this post, when I say "learn how
to do x" I always mean learn the shortcut or the command to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moving around&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine how much time you could save if you were able to go back to
the line of code where you want to paste stuff that you just copied or
open the file where a particular function is defined. Invest some time
in learning how to move across code and files fast and with minimum
effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Searching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using vim or emacs, then you will quickly realize that
searching is an efficient way of moving around. A good editor treats
files, directory listing, configuration interface etc consistently
which means that you can move around these interfaces in the same way
as you do in files. Search in files (rgrep in emacs) is a handy tool
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cut/Copy/Paste and the "kill ring"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's indeed convenient if the editor remembers what all things were
cut or copied in current session and doesn't lose them the moment
something else is copied to the clipboard. It's also important that
you are able to quickly move around the clipboard contents. In emacs
there is a kill ring where anything that's &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;killed&lt;/em&gt; goes and
anything that's &lt;em&gt;pasted&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;yanked&lt;/em&gt; comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As programmers we deal with lines of code, so we must know how to work
with lines.  For eg. deleting to end of line, deleting a line (moving
up the next one), adding a line after the current one (from any
position in the current line) taking the cursor there ready to type,
adding a line before the current one and moving to it to quickly add a
doc string, going to the next line respecting the indent (electric
return), swapping two lines and a lot of other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Region&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps to know how to work on a region of code or text. For
eg. indenting a region to right/left, Commenting/uncommenting a region
and doing things that you normally do in files only on this region
such as search/replace in region, undo/redo in region (yes this is
possible in emacs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;File Browsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have to click on File &amp;gt; Open &amp;gt; Select &amp;gt; Open to open a file in
the editor? If yes, you should change your editor!  Other file
operations such as new file, delete, move, delete directory
recursively are similarly important.  Added bonus if it also allows
chmod and chown. In emacs, all these things are possible in the dired
buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Screen Splitting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often we need to go back and forth between many files to refer to
function definitions, example usage, tests, shell sessions etc.  A
handy feature to have in this case is to be able to view many files at
a time on the screen. Most editors support screen splitting in a
number of ways.  Find out which one works for you and use it to reduce
effort of moving between files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jump to function definition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most editors provide a better and faster way for this than searching
in files. In emacs this can be achieved by generating a TAG table
which is basically just a file that acts as an index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Autocomplete&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single editor, there can be many types of autocompletion
implementations and most of them are very handy and would probably be
the most used in day to day editng. For eg. in emacs we can define
abbreviations which are stored in files and can be expanded by TAB
key. Then there are dynamic abbreviations (M-/) or more sophisticated
Yasnippets which are capable of expanding to commonly used code
templates. I am not a Yasnippets user although I use the other two
types all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Polyglot friendliness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use multiple languages, learn how to configure the editor
differently for various languages for eg. I use 4 spaces indent for
python, php and javascript whereas 2 spaces for ruby and html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Source Control from editor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Git user, I am happy with the command line and don't use any
emacs git mode myself. But I think it is something worth learning and
considering trying out &lt;a href="https://github.com/magit/magit"&gt;Magit&lt;/a&gt; since a
long time but haven't had the time yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Running Shell inside the editor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful and must have feature for any editor. I personally
use it a lot when I am trying out stuff in python or scheme. You can
even evaluate a region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plugins and Extending the editor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, editors have a good plugin ecosystem. If you use an
opensource editor, you can even search github repositories for plugins
that you wouldn't have imagined could exist. Learn how to install or
set them up and also aim towards learning how to write them yourself
and give back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Syntax Checking and Lint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any decent editor supports on the fly syntax checking of code. This
would typically be packaged as a plugin or a mode. There are also
tools that help you find out on the fly whether your code is code
style compatible for eg. whether your python code is
&lt;a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"&gt;PEP 8&lt;/a&gt; compliant or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support for non-programming formats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are that your editor has support for editing files other than
programming languages. For eg. markdown or restructured text.  It's
very handy to have such a feature as it makes editing documentation
convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Macros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macros provide a way to record a set of actions so that they can be
replayed again. As an example, the first non-trivial macros I had used
was for converting a paypal integration form in html to a python
dictionary of parameters to be posted to paypal. It took me around 5
mins to record it and 1 min to repeat it on all the form fields
clearly saving me a lot of time and shit work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Have fun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fun to be able to use your editor for a things for which other
people use softwares that flood the screen with popouts such as email,
irc or even twitter clients, note taking apps or even games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is all I can think of right now. It's definitely by no means
an exhaustive list but I hope this helps you get started with fast,
efficient and enjoyable editing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Adding text vertically on multiple lines (region)</title><link href="http://naiquevin.github.io/adding-text-vertically-on-multiple-lines-region.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-04T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Vineet Naik</name></author><id>tag:naiquevin.github.io,2011-08-04:adding-text-vertically-on-multiple-lines-region.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok. Finally a new emacs trick. Actually I had come across this a while
back but then I went on a short vacation and later picked up a John
Grisham book (one of the hard-to-put-down types) and so the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is about adding stuff vertically in a line in the buffer. It
might seem to be a bit vague and useless at first but it perfectly
fits a problem I face everyday in php-mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now php-mode is not all that great if compared to the rest of the
emacs awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that when I try to comment a region, it wraps each line
of the region in block comments ie. &lt;code&gt;/* */&lt;/code&gt; which looks kind of ugly
and may be objectionable by fellow team members too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started using this command as a work around to comment out a
region in php by prefixing each line with &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I do this is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the mark at the required position on the starting line (in my case
column 0 or the start of the line)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then move the cursor to the ending line using C-n normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then type, &lt;code&gt;C-x r t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;String Rectangle :&lt;/code&gt; will appear in the mini buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; to comment out each line and press &lt;code&gt;RET&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="emacs"></category><category term="editing"></category></entry><entry><title>Bookmarking in Emacs</title><link href="http://naiquevin.github.io/bookmarking-in-emacs.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-22T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Vineet Naik</name></author><id>tag:naiquevin.github.io,2011-07-22:bookmarking-in-emacs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Emacs allows bookmarking inside buffers so that you can quicky visit
those at a later time. And by later time I mean any time later, even
if its a new emacs session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commands are as follows :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set bookmark &lt;code&gt;C-X r m &amp;lt;bookmark_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View bookmarks in the minibuffer &lt;code&gt;C-X r b &amp;lt;up/down arrow&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;C-s&lt;/code&gt; to
I-search (Sounds familiar?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View a list of all bookmarks &lt;code&gt;C-X r l&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delete bookmark &lt;code&gt;C-X r l&lt;/code&gt; (to view list) and then mark with &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; and delete
with &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see a nice thing with emacs is that a lot of old concepts
apply to the newly learned stuff for eg. in this case searching for a
bookmark can be related to searching for open buffers and deleting
bookmarks is to be done just the way we kill open buffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if a bookmark is set, it persists in subsequent sessions as well
until its deleted. And to jump to any set bookmark, it doesn't require
the buffer to be open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never used bookmarks in my previous ide which was eclipse. But here
it seems quite useful to me. I personally don't like the open files in
previous ide session auto-opening up at startup. I prefer starting
with a clean slate. So I can just set a bookmark on the dired buffers
of the projects that I am working on currently or just set one before
wrapping up day's work so that I can start from there the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="emacs"></category><category term="editing"></category></entry><entry><title>Killing buffers</title><link href="http://naiquevin.github.io/killing-buffers.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Vineet Naik</name></author><id>tag:naiquevin.github.io,2011-07-19:killing-buffers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In emacs, as we open files, a lot of dired buffers get accumulated. I
personally find them a nuisance after a while specially during longer
emacs sessions. Killing them one by one using &lt;code&gt;C-X k&lt;/code&gt; would be quite
tedious. Fortunately there is better way to kill many buffers at a
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this we list all the buffers using &lt;code&gt;C-X C-b&lt;/code&gt;. The list opens in
a new buffer so we need to switch to this buffer using &lt;code&gt;C-x o&lt;/code&gt;. Now
we need to mark all the buffers that we wish to kill by typing
&lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;. As we mark, a capital &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; appears alongside the buffers'
names. After all buffers to be killed are marked, just press &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and
all the buffers will get killed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="emacs"></category><category term="editing"></category></entry><entry><title>Keyboard macros in emacs</title><link href="http://naiquevin.github.io/keyboard-macros-in-emacs.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-16T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Vineet Naik</name></author><id>tag:naiquevin.github.io,2011-07-16:keyboard-macros-in-emacs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just learnt how to set and use Keyboard Macros in emacs. This looks
pretty useful and something I feel will come in handy while
refactoring code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, to set a keyboard macros means recording a sequence of
actions (keystrokes) and saving them. Later you can ask emacs to just
repeat them for you whenever you want using a single command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting macros is quite simple,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-X (&lt;/code&gt;  ......begin a macro definition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;...&amp;lt;do some keystrokes that you want to record&amp;gt;...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-X )&lt;/code&gt;  ......end the macro definition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to "play" your recording anywhere, all you need to do is &lt;code&gt;C-X e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine a screnario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a php class (say a controller in an MVC application) the following
expression is written a number of times to get a particular request
param and assign it to a variable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;id&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..............&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;user_id&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose I want to pass a second optional parameter of value &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to 
all of the function calls ie change them such as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;id&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To do this using a macro, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;move to the beginning of the buffer by typing &lt;code&gt;M-S-&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin the macro definition &lt;code&gt;C-X (&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incremental search for &lt;code&gt;$this-&amp;gt;request-&amp;gt;param&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;C-s&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;RET&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;end of line &lt;code&gt;C-e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;backward twice &lt;code&gt;C-b * 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;type &lt;code&gt;, 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;end macro definition &lt;code&gt;C-X )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now keep doing &lt;code&gt;C-X e&lt;/code&gt; till all the method calls are modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This was somewhat a vague example but I hope you get the idea :-))&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="emacs"></category><category term="editing"></category><category term="macros"></category></entry><entry><title>Speedy navigation across the buffer in emacs</title><link href="http://naiquevin.github.io/speedy-navigation-across-the-buffer-in-emacs.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-15T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Vineet Naik</name></author><id>tag:naiquevin.github.io,2011-07-15:speedy-navigation-across-the-buffer-in-emacs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay. So here goes the first one. Very often I find myself searching
for a line of code in the same file so that I can copy it over into
some other function or a method. This whole process of moving to the
desired line of code, copying it over, coming back to where you
started the search and yanking it can be done unbelievably fast in
emacs. This is because emacs keeps setting marks for you automatically
while you navigate through the lines of code (noticed the words "Mark
Set" in the minibuffer ?). In other words it keeps saving your
previous positions. So all you need to master is how to move back to
the previous position quicky after copying. To move to the previous
mark the command is C-u C-SPC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the above scenario the command sequence would be,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-s or C-r (search forward or backward)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-m or RET (after finding the desired line)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-a  (moving to the start of the line)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-SPC (to set the mark)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-e (move to the end of the line thereby selecting a region)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M-w (copy region)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-u C--SPC * 2 (to return back to the initial mark)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like too much work for the fingers but its definitely faster
than the right click scroll thing one would have to do with a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think as if you are driving a racing car. It can go from 0-60 in
3.5 secs, &lt;em&gt;provided&lt;/em&gt; you can shift gears fast enough :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="emacs"></category><category term="editing"></category></entry></feed>
